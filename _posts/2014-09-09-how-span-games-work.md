## How the game works
<ul>
<li>Time: one stimulus is displayed per second. On the first level 2 stimuli are presented for 1 second each. 1 second is added on to the stimuli display on every following level, i.e. one new stimulus is added each level. For example, level 2 displays 3 stimuli over 3 seconds, level 3 displays 4 stimuli over 4 seconds, etc.
<li>Stimuli are displayed for 0.6 of a second.</li>
<li>Stimuli are selected randomly with replacement.</li>
</li>After the stimuli are displayed the user sees a palette with all options from that game's span cuepool. The users presses the button on the palette in the order the stimuli were displayed in the game.</li>
<li>Both correct and incorrect answers have weights of 1.0.</li>
</li>Score is calculated as (1.0 * no. correct answers) / (1.0 * no. stimuli displayed)</li>
</ul>
